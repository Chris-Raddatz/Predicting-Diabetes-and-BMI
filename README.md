# BIOF-475-Final-Project
Final Project for "Intro to Data Science" through the FAES at NIH

Given a dataset, we were instructed to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis to train a machine learning model in logistic regression and linear regression. 

Creating a machine learning algorithm predicting diabetes outcome. Skills in data cleaning, basic visualization, PCA, n-clustering, KMeans and Linear and Logistic Regression. 
Logistic Regression accuracy in predicting outcome was 85%
